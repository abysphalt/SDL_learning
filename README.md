# SDL_learning


This is my journey on learning how to build a game engine with SDL2.

I'm recording each step.

You need SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_mixer, tinyXML, zlib installed.

To compile the file run 
make -f Makefile.linux

alternatively, you can rename the Makefile.linux to Makefile and just run
make
